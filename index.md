## Getting Started

**Imperium** runs as a central monitor between replicas. Replicas need to communicate to each other through **Imperium**. To use the tool,

1. Change implementation codebase to communicate with **Imperium**
2. Run replicas and **Imperium**

There are different modes to run the tool.

1. [_Unit testing_]({% link docs/unit_testing/index.md %})
2. [_Exploration testing_]({% link docs/exploration_testing/index.md %})
3. [_Visualization_]({% link docs/visualization.md %})
