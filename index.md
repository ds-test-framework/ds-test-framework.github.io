## Getting Started

**Imperium** acts as a central monitor that can control all the replicas. This requires the developer to change the implementation being tested. See [instrumentation]({% link docs/instrumentation.md %}) to understand the changes that are required. **Imperium** can be used for:

1. [_Unit testing_]({% link docs/unit_testing/unit_testing.md %})
2. [_Exploration testing_]({% link docs/exploration_testing/index.md %})
3. [_Visualization_]({% link docs/visualization.md %})
